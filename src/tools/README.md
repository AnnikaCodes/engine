This folder contains miscellaneous scripts and tools useful for working on the pkmn engine:

- [`debug.zig`](debug.zig)/[`debug.ts`](debug.ts): Use for debugging the translation layer between
  the the Zig and TypeScript libraries (primarily testing serialization/deserialization).

      $ zig build debug -Dshowdown > <FILE>
      $ node build/tools/debug <FILE>

- [`generate.ts`](generate.ts): Generate the the data files for the library based on
  [templates](../lib/common/data) and [`id.json`](../pkg/data/ids.json) for decoding the serialized
  data. Produces the data based on information fetched from the decompiled sources and Pokémon
  Showdown.

      $ make generate

  Can also be used to generate unit testing stubs:

      $ npm run generate  -- tests <GEN>

  The `--force` flag can be used to ensure that the data is refetched from the source instead of
  from a local `.cache` directory.

- [`protocol.zig`](protocol.zig): Print out offsets and constants required to properly encode and
  decode the pkmn [protocol](../../docs/PROTOCOL.md).

      $ zig build protocol -- markdown > tmp/protocol.md
      $ zig build protocol -- <protocol|layout> > src/pkg/data/<protocol|layout>.json

- [`rng.zig`](rng.zig): Display the distribution of random numbers generated by both Pokémon
  Showdown and the cartridge for various events and highlights where they differ.

      $ zig build rng -- crit 93
      $ zig build rng -- sleep
