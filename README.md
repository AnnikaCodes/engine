## Installation

The driver code can be installed from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pkmn/engine):

```sh
$ npm install @pkmn/engine
```

The `zig` compiler is required to build the actual engine code. The Zig website has [installation
instructions](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/) which walk through how to do this on each
platform - the engine code currently is being built and tested against the latest Zig nightly
development builds (`>= 0.9.0-dev.1583+a7d215759`).

After successfully installing `zig` , clone this repository (optionally with the `--depth` flag set
to `1` to perform a shallow copy) and run `zig build` from within the directory that has been
created by `git`:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pkmn/engine.git # --depth 1
$ cd engine
$ zig build --prefix .
```

All binaries will end up in `bin` and libraries in `lib` . See `zig build --help` for build options.
