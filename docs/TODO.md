# TODO

## Experiments

- [ ] bit shuffling stdio between Zig and JS (can JS spawn engine and communicate with it)?
- [ ] determine domain/range in each gen of possible protocol `Args` and `KWArgs`
- [ ] `zig-napi-example` based on [`Tigerbeetle-node`](https://github.com/coilhq/tigerbeetle-node)
  - [ ] run on Linus/macOS/Windows
  - [ ] do postinstall of Zig if required (pinned) version is not present + download node headers
- [ ] change `ps/integration` lockstep test to operate on `Battle` directly instead of `BattleStream`

## Protocol

- [ ] consider [`serialization.zig`](https://github.com/ziglang/std-lib-orphanage/blob/master/std/serialization.zig)

## Performance

## Driver

- [ ] support both stdio (reading and writing buffers across stdio) and Node-API
- [ ] implements binary protocol encode/decode
- [ ] turn `Battle.update` responses into `|request|` ~~(can consider moving down a layer into an
  optional piece of the engine)~~
- [ ] **integration tests**: run streams in lockstep (like `@pkmn/sim`) and compare output *and*
  ensure binary protocol roundtrips
  - [x] override PS `PRNG` to match `@pkmn/engine` for the specific gens!

## Engine

- [ ] evaluate writer APIs - use [buffered writing](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/4358) -
  ensure protocol is a single syscall (`write`? `writev`? `mmap`?)
- [x] update code-generation to use `mustache` and templates in `lib/common/data`
- [x] generate all data for Gen 1 - 8 ~~once `@pkmn/data` has support for IDs~~ (will need different
  templates based on generation ranges)
- [ ] implement binary protocol *encoding* via 0-copy low overhead approach that can be compiled
  out of the library
- [x] add datatypes (`pokemon.zig`, `side.zig`, etc) for Gen 2
- [x] move `stored` out of `Pokemon` and into `party`/`team`, justify `level` duplication
- [ ] add tests to ensure each documented glitch either works or is deliberately not implemented
  (eg. desyncs)
- [ ] watch out for [packed](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/9943)
  [struct](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/10104) issues
- [ ] ensure trace is 0 overhead in MCTS build (use `@import("build_options")` to mark as dead code)

## Project

- [x] add `Makefile` to handle orchestrating `npm` vs. `zig` build management (generate, build,
  install, lint, fix, test, etc)
- [ ] figure out how to automatically cross-compile release artifacts and cut releases based on
  tags
- [ ] `README.md`
  - [x] installation instructions (move development instructions to alternate section)
  - [ ] feature set
  - [ ] usage
  - [ ] disclaimer (Pok√©mon Showdown comparison - link to `DESIGN.md` for differences with PS)
- [ ] add big-endian architecture to CI tests (eg. [using
  `qemu-mips`](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/master/tests/RustTest.sh#L18-L22))
