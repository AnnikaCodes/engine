explain difference between engine and simulator (engine: just subset of Battle. no battle stream (driver), no team validator/format awareness etc. minimal protocol support (not full protocol).)

how the engine can be used for the damage calc

- mcts
- damage calc (how? need to give example)

non goal: fully feature data lib - general functionality at odds with performance

```txt
full architecture design docs
goals: speed, accuracy
- dont pay at all for abstractions etc not used in the gen (gen 2 doesnt pay for inheritance of gen 1, doesnt have to deal with `spc`, etc) = possibly a lot less code reuse! inheritance can be done at compile time (just pointers, no redundant memory). gen 8 doesnt need to pay for gen 1->7

text => all text (descriptions, short desc, names, etc) in separate translatable files
IDs (ints) most fundamental -> looking up data should be looking up in array!

1) faster (event dispatch?, use numbers instead of strings)  
2) same protocol? (at least need to be able to translate to ps protocol)  
3) DAMAGE CALC (need to be able to return all randoms with same code, also force events to always proc)  
4) MINMAX (need to be able to proc multiple possibilies)  
5) MCTS (efficient state representation)

- convert to PS protocol (after) for compatibility
- dont include input/ouput logs in text encoding (like trace!) can still rematerialize, just cant display same results

```

TODO Performance

- constraint: engine (but not required for wrapper) does not allocate any dynamic memory
- constraint: no pointers in data representation - must be copyable by `mem.copy`
- native endianess for trivial input/output
- padding, alignment, cache lines
- dont create protocol objects, just write byes directly to stream

PS could be made more perfomant by po/optimize:

```txt
Events - don't go over all the events each time, instead have array of NUMEVEMT and have monsters reg and dereg where appropriate, then just need to look up if theres any handlers. Num handlers for each event could also possibly be fixed to small N (20?), Always use naive insertion sort to keep sorted since small arrays. FULLY STACK.  
- when to add and remove?  
- monsters should not poll over the fields either, can precompute when turning set to Mon which events it needs to reg and dereg? NO SEARching full static lookups
```

also rethinking IDs to be numbers not strings, minimizing string parsing, etc

- binary for each gen, simulate glue script in JS which includes driver `pkmn/simulate gen1` => `pkmn/bin/gen1`
- library `pkmn/lib/pkmn.so` which is `-OReleaseFast` but two modes, one with trace, one without trace

Most inter-gen releases just deal with legality (team validator, handled at a higher level), but can include data changes (Hypnosis in gen 4) and even data presence causes problems - eg trouble implementing `gen8-dlc1` given moves like Metronome etc might depdend on moves which don't exist

- would need to add `Release` to battle and do `if` checks in relevant places like Metronome handler
  
0 error = mcts random playouts over library, no streaming just accumulating stats. however, provided multiple roots (possible instantiations)? , optionally with weights - epoke run in js

also have pure MCTS random playout function - naive (not heavy) playouts, focused on speed: need to be careful about omniscience

```txt
Battle update(u16, ?[BUF]trace) -> info about win or lose and requesttype for either player. if trace is provided will output trace protocol lines (null separated? protocol type plus args plus etc - is chunk and line bounded? run PS a while and figure out chunk arg lenghts and kwargs)  
```

todo: can turn basepower/accuracy/effect chance into enums because sparse (requires another table lookup then) - alternatively can at least drop 0 from accuracy and make u4 instead of u8, pp is 2*pp%10 as well

PROTOCOL

auto build json string as ascii in Int8Array? vs string concat vs json?
if manually building ascii why not just make the protocol text to begin with? zig text is already the same thing that could be accomplished? text should only be for things which require trace, mcts doesn t require trace so could just as easily use datastrucute and return value!

what data is required to unpack? can just unpack? mods rules formats etc - need some predefined headers via format. no validation
binary protocol - less bytes written at

text munging separable from actual engine - high level concerned with munging? problem - names

DRIVER

ensure monomorphic (can do decode function on certain bytes to populate field, then a toJSON), though decode should auto pull out to toJSON representation to save space? any additional details can be saved on a second field (ie. if necessary toJSON returns json field immediately) - can we just build the decode into Battle and do the whole thing at once instead of making separate classes?

JS - just napi to expose Engine.init and Engine.update. engine = binary protocol so languages dont need to string parse
js = wrap with napi and expose binary directly, but also implement code to turn into json/text and be fully comparable etc. will NOT implement a stream (also for reasons of speed) - how to handle clients using synchronously? clients need to say ahead of time which streams theyre interested in and will receive updates automically.

NOT actually json, skip parsig entirely and just return protocol?
just do protocol.deepequals but ignore order of keys, filter out unsupported

```ts
import * as engine from pkmn/engine
const engine = new Engine(gen, p1, p2); // need to specify whether doubles or not

let result; // requestState (or win/end/tie etc)
while (result = engine.update(choice)) {
  choice = ...
}
```

TESTING - exhaustive runner

parse directly to @protocol (no json), though allow for protocol to be stringified (though wont match). add logic to compare protocol directly (order insenstivie), filter out fields which arent implement like break or rules

run PS in battle stream and run through protocol parser. run engine synchronously and gather all converted update/sideupdate data, compare

BENCHMARK - custom multi random runner
checksum = final seed pkus sum of turns

generate teams for each (not included in timing)
dont include team packing time for PS, dont include team encoding time for JS (though optionally can)
play out exact same battle using random ai, only disable trace output for engine and use a binary random ai that makes same decisions as ps but purely off the data it reads directly out of the casted bytes of the engines Battle instance

js

- binary trace and state dump to @pkmn/protocol
- stringify and deepequals for protocol
- randomplayer ai which works purely on binary (can optionally pull on 0 error random player ai and implement it in zig insteadâ€¦., need to compare the js version with ps to zig version. use fast random generator LCRNG)

need to have both libs loaded, with and without? alternative just provide command in package.json to let the user switch engines to untraced! engine code can detect if its available for use and try to use the faster lib if trace is false, falling back to slow lib (we ship zig with the package and just provide a different install option)

alternatively - dont ship zig or binary at all (no postinstall). instead provide binary that can be USED to install(ie. let users choose to set up a postinstall or not, where they can run the install-pkmn-engine binary)
